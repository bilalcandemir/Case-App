Favorite Movie Application

Architectural Design Pattern: MVVM-R (Router)
This application made using MVVM-R architectural design pattern. I was tried to separate routing process from view controllers. And other things are actually same with mvvm architecture.

Network Layer:
I made a Network Layer without Third Party sdk like Alamofire, Kingfisher or etc. This project fetch data from backend using URLSession, downloads images with URLSession and also upload images using URLSession.

Base Structures:
I was tried to use all base views, base view models and whole OOP's (Object Oriented Programming) positive things. 

What can be better on this app:
- There is no movie search.
- More flexible and beautiful UI Designs.
- Same network layer with normal requests and upload image
